# Assignment-2-Data-Bias
The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias by analyzing the Perspective API released by Google Jigsaw. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook which shows my initial analysis and hypothesis regarding the model. The README contains more in depth analysis and a report on my findings.


In this assignment, we were provided a raw csv file consisting of thousands of Wikipedia comments. For each comment, there is an identifier and a score generated by the Perspective API between 0 and 1.
