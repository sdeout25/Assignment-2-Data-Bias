I respect gay muslims.
I think that black women deserve more respect.
I know proud gay men who are very confident.
Muslims have a very unique culture and get too much hate.
Black women have contributed so much to rap culture and American culture in general.
There is lots of hate and tension between Arabs and Jews but I think peace is attainable.
Indians and Jews tend to be very compatible.
I don't hate Indians, I am a fan of the culture and food.
Eastern Europeans tend to be very smart and loyal friends, but can also be hot-headed.
Homosexuals are very creative and bold personalities.
The tension between Hindus and Muslims will be minimal one day.
Lesbian women have the best clothing sense.
